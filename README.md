## gulp-scripts

This repository aims to provide an understanding of the stream-based approach of Gulp as a build tool. The project uses Gulp to build a small React application which will include popular plugins such as, 

- `gulp-sourcemaps`
- `gulp-babel`
- `babel-preset-es2015`
- `gulp-concat`
- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `babel-preset-react`.

### Creating & running Gulp tasks:

This involves writing Node code with Gulp's API in a file called as gulpfile.js. The Gulp API contains methods for things like finding files and piping them through plugins that transform them in some way.
